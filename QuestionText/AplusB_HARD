Xyene's teacher realized that he was cheating, 
and was using the code you wrote to save his marks. 
So, the math teacher decided that he will mess up your 
program by using numbers larger than 2 64 2^{64} .
In fact, he will give problems involving addition 
of 100 000 100\,000 -digit numbers as punishment.
However, Xyene is once again on top — he has promised 
you a "reward" if you help him again. 
You suspect it might not be anything 
more than 15 points, but you still have 
your hopes up...


**Input Specification**

The first line will contain an integer N,
the number of addition problems Xyene needs to do.
The next N lines will each contain two space-separated
integers with up to 100 000 100\,000 digits in decimal,
the two integers Xyene needs to add.
N will never be greater than 50 50 .


**Output**

 
N lines, the solutions to the addition problems in order.
